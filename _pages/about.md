# 📄 About Me

I am a master's student at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Prof. Haiyun Guo](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~haiyun.guo) and under the leadership of [Prof. Jinqiao Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~jinqiaowang). I am also a member of the [Zidongtaichu Foundation Model Research Center](https://zky-dev.wair.ac.cn/).  

My research focuses on **multimodal large language models**, **multimodal retrieval**, and **reinforcement learning**. I am currently an intern at the Wenxin (ERNIE Bot) team at Baidu.  

I am actively seeking opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. If you find my background and interests aligned with your research, I would be sincerely grateful for the opportunity to connect and discuss further.
